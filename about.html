    <p>The name Enhypen was introduced during the live broadcast of the 
      final episode of I-Land. Etymologically, the group
       derives their name from the hyphen symbol (-),
       representing "Connection, Discovery, & Growth".
      
    <br>JUNGWON, HEESEUNG, JAY, JAKE, SUNGHOON, SUNOO, NI-KI
    ENHYPEN is the first boyband created by BELIFT LAB, consisting of seven multinational members JUNGWON, HEESEUNG, JAY, JAKE, SUNGHOON, SUNOO and NI-KI. They are the finalists of global music competition show ‘I-LAND,’ which finished airing in September 2020. The members have already shown infinite possibilities and growth not only as individuals, but also as a team. Similar to the ‘hyphen(-)’ that connects one word to another, ENHYPEN means that seven different boys connect to discover one another and grow together. It also indicates their ambitious plan to connect people and the world through their music.</p>
